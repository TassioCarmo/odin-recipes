    <p>Chocolate crinkle cookies have become a holiday staple, but they're also great any time of year. They're cake-like cookies made with unsweetened cocoa powder, vegetable oil, and a handful of other pantry staple ingredients.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 3/4 c. all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>3/4 c. unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp. kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp. baking powder</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp. baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 c. (1 stick) butter, melted </li>
        <li>3/4 c. granulated sugar </li>
        <li>1/2 c. packed brown sugar </li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>Powdered sugar, for rolling</li>
    </ul>

        <li> Step 1
            In a large bowl, combine flour, cocoa powder, salt, baking powder, and baking soda. 
        </li>
        <li>Step 2
            In a medium bowl, whisk together melted butter, sugars, and eggs until well combined. Pour into dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours. 
        </li>
        <li>Step 3
            Preheat oven to 350° and line 2 large baking sheets with parchment. Place powdered sugar in a small bowl. Scoop about 2 tablespoons of dough and roll into a ball. If dough is too sticky, wet your hands slightly to help roll dough. Roll dough into powdered sugar, coating well and then place on prepared baking sheet 2” apart. After rolling all the dough in powdered sugar, roll each piece again in powdered sugar. This will help get a more dramatic crinkle when the cookies bake. 
        </li>
        <li>Step 4
            Bake cookies until cookies puff and crack, about 14 minutes. The edges will just be set, but the cracks will still look slightly underdone. Let cool on baking sheet.
