    <p>Chocolate fondue is made of chocolate and heavy whipping cream. Vanilla and salt can also be added if desired. Milk chocolate, semi-sweet chocolate, dark chocolate or bittersweet chocolate can be used.</p>
    
    <ul><strong>For the dipping fondue chocolate:</strong>
        <li>
            1 cup (8 ounces) heavy cream
        </li>
        <li>
            Pinch salt
        </li>
        <li>
            12 ounces milk or dark chocolate (chips or roughly chopped bar)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <ul><strong>For dipping:</strong>
        <li>
            Strawberries
        </li>
        <li>
            Banana pieces cut into 1-inch chunks
        </li>
        <li>
            Dried apricots
        </li>
        <li>
            Apple slices
        </li>
    </ul>

    <ol> <h3>Steps</h3>
        <li> 
            <p>Heat the cream with a pinch of salt over medium heat in a small saucepan until tiny bubbles show and begins to lightly and slowly simmer.</p> 
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>A dutch oven warming milk to show how to make fondue.
                Remove from heat and add the chocolate:
                Remove from heat, add the chocolate, and whisk until smooth and fully incorporated.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Transfer the chocolate mix to a fondue pot heated at low or with a low flame, or serve straight from the pot.         </p>
            <p>Arrange the dip-ables on a platter or plates around the chocolate pot.</p>
            <p>Use a fondue fork, bamboo skewer, seafood fork, or salad fork to dip the fruit pieces and other dip-ables into the hot melted chocolate mixture. Eat immediately.</p>
            <p>If the fondue begins to feel a little stiff, add a tablespoon of heavy cream and stir. It will help it go a little longer. Eventually, it will cook down though, and you may need to start a new pot.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Bake cookies until cookies puff and crack, about 14 minutes. The edges will just be set, but the cracks will still look slightly underdone. Let cool on baking sheet.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
